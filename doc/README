# CLIIDE: Command Line Interface Integrated Development Environment

This system consists of a set of scripts that effectively create a CLI IDE 
environment for C/C++ projects.  It has a number of useful features, not the 
least of which is generating the makefile system for you, so that building the 
project is as easy as `make` in the build directory.

Note that, due to the recent rewrite, this documentation is horrendously 
incomplete.

## Creating a Project ##

## Adding a Binary Module ##

## Adding a Header Module ##

## Adding a Module ##

## Adding a Function ##

## Adding a Struct ##

## Adding a Typedef ##

## Adding a Constant ##

## Special Files ##

### .clang-format ###

### src/<module>/.makefile ###

This file exists in the toplevel module of a compiled entity.  It contains the 
makefile hooks and variables specific to that entity.  There are variables 
defined at the top for configuring inter-module dependencies, and module-local 
compile and link options.

### src/<module>/.build ###

## Removing a File, Module, Struct, Etc... ##

One of the major design considerations in this system was the ability to use 
`rm` on anything created by the scripts, and not have it break anything.  If you 
create something and later want to remove it, then you can absolutely use `rm`.
