The input and output formatting should be tweaked to match what I actually will 
do.  A reformatting tool to enforce things might get involved.

Functions should be able to add a first argument (T * canonical_name) if the 
module has a type in it.

The makefile constantly rebuilds binaries.  This is because creating the object 
file updates the module directory, and the module directory timestamp is checked 
to determine wether or not the internal module cpp file should be regenerated.  
The check is necessary, as removing a module from within the toplevel binary 
module would only be visible through such a timestamp.  The only way to change 
this is to move the object file output to another location.

Better hooks should be included to specify dependencies between built modules 
within a project.  If this could be extended to dependencies between projects, 
that would be amazing.

Variadic arguments are not handled well.  I do not know if variadic functions 
can be exported in shared object files, but if they can, we should probably 
support that.

C++'s shitty template support for code organized in this way is a real shame, 
and C's preprocessor is really an unacceptable solution.  Metaprogramming is 
severely lacking in this system, and that is one of it's biggest weaknesses.
